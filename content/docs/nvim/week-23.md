# Indenting text
Indenting text can be quite common in programming.
You might want to format comments or text later printed to terminal.
Vim can also give you a hand here.

## Indenting
Indenting can be done with selecting text and then using `<` and `>` keys.
Whilst this is useful for formatting text after it has been written you can also indent in insert mode.
For that we have `^D` and `^T` for deindent and indent respectively.

## Shifting paragraphs or other text objects
Indenting can be also done on text objects.
For that you can do `>ap` for example to shift current paragraph.
