# Manipulating numbers
It is quite often, that we do not treat numbersr just as text, but as actual numbers.
We might wish to either increment, decrement or perform any other numerical operations.

## Incrementing and decrementing
Incrementing and decrementing can be done with `C-a` and `C-x`.
You simply have to have your cursor on the same line and then the command modifies the first
number on the given line.
