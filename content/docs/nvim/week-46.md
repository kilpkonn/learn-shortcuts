# Scroll in insert mode
Vim allows scrolling without leaving insert mode.
This is mainly useful if you find staring at the top or bottom of your screen annoying and wish to move to cursor up/down on the monitor.

# Usage
Scrolling in insert mode can be done with `C-x C-y` (scroll up) and `C-x C-e` (scroll down).
Exiting scroll mode can be done with `ESC` as usual.
