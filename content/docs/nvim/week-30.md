# Moving in visual mode
In visual mode, there are some extra options to normal mode to select text easierly.
Namely you can jump around already selected code.

## Jump to the other side of selection
The `o` key can be used to jump to the other side of selection.
Namely it jumps from corner to corner on diagonal.
To jump to other end of selection on current line, use `O`.
With these two, it is possible to change current selection without reseting it.
