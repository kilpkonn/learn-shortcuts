# Reselectiong last visual selection
You select text, copy it and continue with other stuf..
Now you suddenly want to make the same selection again, but redoing all the motions is slow and cumbersome.

## The `gv` command
There is a `gv` command in Vim, that goes to visual selection mode and reselects last selection again.
Might be super handy when you have some REPL oen in separate window and copy your code there.
