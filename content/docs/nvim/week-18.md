# More on navigation
`hjkl` is nice and some stuff such as `0` and `$` give extra touch, but there is much more available in vim.
In this week we'll come some of the options I've personally rarely used, but which can be very useful.

## Move to next occurance
One way to skip couple of keystrokes is to jump around with `f` followed by a letter you want to jump to.
You can do the same going backwards direction with `F`.
`t` and `T` operate in a similar manner, but places cursor just before the char.

## Jump between brakets
The `%` shortcut can be used to jump between matching brakets, even if there are other levels of braket inside it.

## Move around text
`{` and `}` Can be useful when moving around paragraphs.
They actually jump to clear lines before or after the paragraph.
`(` and `)` Move around by sentence at a time.
