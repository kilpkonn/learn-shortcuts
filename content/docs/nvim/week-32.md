# Append to registers
Sometimes it is convenient to append some data to registers.
The most likely usecase is:
1. Record macro with `qa`
2. Stop recording with `q`
3. Realize, something needs to be added to macro
4. Append keystrokes you previously left out

## Apending keystrokes
Appending can be done with `qA` to continue the example above.
For other registers, simply use other capital letters.
You can end the recording with `q` as always.
