# Commands in insert mode
As discussed previously, in Vim you normally in sert in insert mode and delete in normal mode.
However, there is a sleek way to temporarly tap into normal mode, run command and return to insert mode.

## This is how
`<C-o>` is a simple shortcut to tap into normal mode for single command.
After running the command you are automatically put back into insert mode.
Easy as that, enjoy.
