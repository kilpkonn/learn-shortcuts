# Moving around in search results
Everybody knows that we can search with `/` and then move around the results with `n` and `N`.
However there is also a way to move around the results without leaving the command line mode.

# Basic usage
`<C-g>` Takes you to the next match and `<C-t>` takes you to the previous match.
Nothing special here :D
