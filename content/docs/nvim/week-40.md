# Sorting text
Vim has also builtins for operations such as sorting text.
Some of it is quite basic but there are also some quite fancy options.

# Basics
Sorting in vim is done with the `sort` command or `sort!` for reverse direction.

# Options
Useful options for sorting:
- `i` - ignore case
- `n` - sort by first decimal on line
- `f` - sort by first float on line
- `/pattern/` sort by what comes **after** the match
- `r` sort by what is in pattern
