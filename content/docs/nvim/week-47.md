# More on completion
Most regular autocompletion cases are handled for me by `nvim-cmp` but there are still some cool completion related shortcuts that are good to know.

# Most useful shortcuts
- `C-x C-l` - Complete whole line from buffer
- `C-x C-f` - Complete filepath under cursor (expands env vars)
- `C-x s` - Complete with spelling suggestion
- `C-x C-v` - Complete with command line history
