Here are some tims to accomplish that.\nReplace in visually seleceted range #   Select range in visual mode Press \u0026lt;:\u0026gt; to start range action, you should see something like this:  :\u0026#39;\u0026lt;,\u0026#39;\u0026gt;Type in replace command as usual eg. for foo -\u0026gt; bar  :\u0026#39;\u0026lt;,\u0026#39;\u0026gt;s/foo/bar/gReplace last visually selected range in normal mode #   Select range in visual mode Exit to normal mode Start command with \u0026lt;:\u0026gt; as usual Use \\%V to restrict selection to previously selected visual range. Replace usual eg. for foo -\u0026gt; bar  :%s/\\%Vfoo/bar/gReplace multiple ranges #  You can also select range in command mode with :start,end and run command on it. You can then also chain renaming in multiple ranges like so\n:18,20s/foo/bar/g | 28,30\u0026amp;\u0026amp;"}]
